# 🐾 Animal Shelter Manager

## Purpose

Animal Shelter Manager is a web application designed to help associations manage the animals under their care. It simplifies the processes of registering and updating information about animals, adoption or foster families, and any veterinary interventions. The application is accessible via any browser and supports multiple users with different access levels.

The project prioritizes:
- Reliable data persistence (relational storage)
- Information security (access control and protection of sensitive data)
- Intuitive usage (responsive and user-friendly interface)

## Status
